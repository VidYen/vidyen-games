	<p>VYPS allows you to gamify monetization by giving your users a reason to turn off adblockers in return for rewards and recognition.</p>
	<p>This is a multi-part system, similar to WooCommerce, that allows WordPress administrators to track points for rewards using monetization systems.</p>
	<p>To prevent catastrophic data loss, uninstalling this plugin will no longer automatically delete the VYPS user data. To drop your VYPS tables from the WPDB, use the VYPS Uninstall plugin to do a clean install.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Base Plugin Instructions</h2>
	<p>Navigate to the Add Points menu to add points.</p>
	<p>Go to the Users panel and use the context menu by Edit User Information under Edit Points to modify or see a userâ€™s current point balance.</p>
	<p>Go to Point Log in the VidYen Points menu to see a log of all user transactions.</p>
	<p>See the shortcode menus on how to integrate this on your WordPress site.</p>
